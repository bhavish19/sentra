"""
Packing safety for SENTRA (protocol step 5).

Central guard: 2*(t + s - 1) < n_active.
- t: privacy threshold (need t+1 shares to reconstruct)
- s: packing factor (PSS packing factor, or adversarial share limit depending on context)
- n_active: number of currently active nodes

On failure: lower s, re-pack via DPSS, or stop with a clear error.
